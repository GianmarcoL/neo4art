# Wikipedia Structures

As you may know wikipedia pages are grouped into `categories` and
The category we are most interested in is of course [Category:Arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Arts)
and some of its sub-categories are really useful for `neo4art`.
As a very basic approach, wikipedia categories could become [neo4j labels](http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/graphdb-neo4j-labels.html).

Another interesting structure element of a wikipedia page are `templates`.
As you can read, [templates]([templates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates).)
"_are pages that are embedded (transcluded) into other pages to allow for the repetition of information_",
but from our point of view, template are really useful to find specific information regarding the topic presented in a specific page.
For example the [Infobox person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_person) template contains really useful information about people: _birth_name_, _birth_date_, _birth_place,
while the [Infobox settlement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_settlement) template contains information about cities
and [Coord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Coord) template contains geospatial data.
From our point of view, wikipedia templates will become [neo4j node properties](http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/rest-api-node-properties.html).
