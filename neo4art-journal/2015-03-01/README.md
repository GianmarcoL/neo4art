# Neo4Art - Journal: March, 1st 2015

Today we spent some hours trying to populate some interesting entities:

* Colours
* Emotions
* Animals

Those entities are of course common themes for every artist and art in general,
and Neo4Art search engine will use these entities to find topics you could be interested in.

## Todo

Other entities we want to populate are:

* Places
* Cities
* Churches
* Objects
* Museums
* Exhibitions

## Bold Thanks!

**If you like our idea, please consider to become one contributor of this project!**
